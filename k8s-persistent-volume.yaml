# For GKE Autopilot, we'll use emptyDir volumes in the deployment files
# This is simpler for development and doesn't require external storage setup
# The database will be recreated each time pods restart, but that's fine for testing

# Note: For production, you would need to:
# 1. Create a Cloud Filestore instance
# 2. Use the NFS server IP in the PersistentVolume
# 3. Or use Cloud SQL for the database

# This file is kept for reference but not used in Autopilot
